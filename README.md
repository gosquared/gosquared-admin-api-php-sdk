# GoSquared Admin API SDK
*The official PHP SDK for the GoSquared admin API*

The Admin API enables you to seamlessly offer GoSquared services to your users. Using the SDK, you can achieve seamless integration with GoSquared that is transparent to the user, allowing you to create and manage GoSquared accounts within your service itself. No redirects or extraneous steps required.

This simplifies the reselling process, so you can bring the power of [GoSquared Analytics](http://www.gosquared.com/features/) to your service without compromising or complicating overall UX.

Whilst this project is a PHP SDK only, the admin API is REST so it is perfectly easy to use in other languages. All examples are accompanied by equivalent HTTP requests which you can use as reference.

For instructions and examples, read the [Documentation](http://gosquared.github.com/gosquared-admin-api-php-sdk/)
